// The end-to-end review pipeline: wires auth -> clone -> diff -> review ->
// publish -> cleanup into the single `JobRunner` the queue (see queue.ts)
// invokes per job, plus the `JobCleanup` hook the queue falls back to on a
// timeout.
//
// Pipeline order for a single job:
//
//   1. Require `job.installationId` (can't mint a token without it).
//   2. Mint ONE fresh installation token (github.ts) and build ONE Octokit
//      client from it, reused for every GitHub API call this job makes
//      (PR metadata, diff, and the final published comment). This mirrors
//      github.ts's "mint fresh per job, no cross-job cache" principle at the
//      per-job granularity: one token, minted once, used everywhere it's
//      needed, then allowed to expire naturally — never re-minted or cached
//      across jobs. We deliberately do NOT use `createInstallationOctokit`
//      (see github.ts): that helper re-derives its own token internally via
//      `authStrategy`, which would mean two tokens minted per job instead of
//      one.
//   2a. Mint ONE fresh gateway virtual key (gateway.ts's
//      `mintGatewayKeyFromConfig`, M4-B) scoped to `config.llm.model`, with a
//      budget/TTL from `config.gateway`. From here on the rest of the job
//      body runs inside a `try/finally` that revokes this key on every exit
//      path (success, a thrown error, or a "review failed" result) — mirrors
//      step 3's workspace `try/finally` one level out, since the key must
//      outlive (and be cleaned up around) everything the workspace cleanup
//      already wraps. Revocation is best-effort and never throws (see
//      gateway.ts) — a revoke failure is logged but never changes the job's
//      outcome. The minted key's `.key` is threaded straight into
//      `runReview` below as `gatewayApiKey` (M4-C), which sets it as the
//      review container's `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` — the orchestrator never
//      holds (and, since M4-C, no longer even loads — see config.ts) a real
//      provider key to substitute instead.
//   3. Create the credential-free host workspace (workspace.ts) for the PR
//      head checkout. From here on the rest of the job body runs inside a
//      (nested) `try/finally` so the workspace is always cleaned up, on every
//      exit path (success, a thrown error, or a "review failed" result — the
//      last of those is not an error at all, see step 6).
//   4. Compute the PR diff via the GitHub API (diff.ts), capped by
//      `config.limits.maxDiffLines`.
//   5. Fetch PR title/body/head sha (needed by the reviewer prompt; the
//      queue's `JobDescriptor` deliberately doesn't carry title/body — see
//      queue.ts). This call is deliberately made AFTER the diff fetch and
//      AFTER the workspace checkout (which itself pins to `job.headSha` and
//      fails closed if a force-push landed before checkout — see
//      workspace.ts) so its `head.sha` can be compared against `job.headSha`
//      to detect a force-push that landed *after* checkout but before/during
//      the diff fetch (see HEAD VERIFY below) — the one race window
//      workspace.ts's own pre-checkout check can't cover.
//   5a. HEAD VERIFY: if the just-fetched `pr.head.sha` no longer matches
//      `job.headSha`, the workspace (pinned to the old head) and the diff
//      (fetched against the new head) are now an incoherent pair — publishing
//      a review built from them could describe the wrong commit. Log and
//      return WITHOUT publishing; a fresh webhook delivery for the new head
//      will re-trigger a review of the current state (same benign-loss
//      rationale as a crash mid-job — see PLAN.md §3).
//   6. Turn the diff into a `ReviewResult`: an oversized diff never reaches
//      `runReview` at all (diff.ts never even fetches the body — see its
//      module doc comment) and instead gets a synthesized "skipped" summary;
//      everything else is handed to reviewer.ts's `runReview`, which never
//      throws — a failed review is a normal `{ ok: false, reason }` value,
//      not an exception, and is published just like a successful one.
//   7. Publish exactly one review/comment (publisher.ts), branching on the
//      shape of `result`:
//        - `{ ok: false }` (review failed) -> `publishReview` (M1's single
//          `issues.createComment` failure-note path, unchanged).
//        - `{ ok: true }` but `prDiff.tooLarge` (the synthesized skipped-review
//          summary from step 6) -> `publishReview` too (M1's single summary
//          comment, unchanged) — there are no real findings to anchor.
//        - `{ ok: true }` from a real `runReview` call -> anchor its findings
//          against the diff (anchor.ts's `anchorFindings`) and publish the
//          result as ONE PR review with inline comments plus a summary body
//          (`publishReviewWithFindings`), so diff-anchored findings surface as
//          inline comments instead of being flattened into plain text.
//
// SECURITY: the installation token minted in step 2 is a live GitHub
// credential. It is only ever passed to `new Octokit({ auth: token })` and to
// `createWorkspace({ token })` (which itself only ever sends it over the
// process environment to `git`, never argv or disk — see workspace.ts). It is
// never logged, never included in a log payload below, and never reaches the
// reviewer subprocess (reviewer.ts strips all `MAGPIE_*` env vars from that
// child's environment before spawning it). Every log line emitted by this
// module is a plain object of ids/counts/urls — never the token, never
// `config.secrets`, never the raw Octokit client, never a gateway master key
// or minted virtual key (gateway.ts's own mint/revoke functions carry the
// same never-log discipline for those — see gateway.ts's module doc comment).
